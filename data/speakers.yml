    talk: "SQL to NoSQL to NewSQL and the rise of polyglot persistence"
    bio: "Paul Dix is cofounder and CTO of InfluxData, the company behind InfluxDB, the open source time series database. He has helped build software for startups, large companies and organizations like Microsoft, Google, McAfee, Thomson Reuters, and Air Force Space Command. He is the series editor for Addison Wesley's Data & Analytics book and video series. In 2010 Paul wrote the book Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails for Addison Wesley's Professional Ruby series."
    synopsis: "The last ten years have brought many new developments in databases. Previously developers had SQL as the dominant and nearly only paradigm for databases. Then in the mid-aughts the rise of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase and others brought new paradigms and options to developers. Over the last few years there seems to have been a swing back to NewSQL or scalable databases that support the SQL standard. In this talk we'll look at some of the new database models like document, data structure, time series, and key/value. I'll look at use cases where these different models end up being a better fit for their problem domains than SQL, the previous one true language to rule them all."

    synopsis: "Processes in Erlang / Elixir resemble objects in many ways. Some even argue that Erlang processes and the Actor Model are a purer form of object-orientation. The Elixir community has a large contingent of Rubyists that have extended many of the core values (and joys) of Ruby into the world of Elixir. This talk exposes some of the reasons why while providing a starting point for further learning"

    talk: "The Rubyist's Illustrated Rust Adventure Survival Guide"
    bio: "Liz is currently wrangling the JavaScripts and herding the Rubies as an engineer at Tilde. Previously, she spent many years drawing comic books to a limited but enthusiastic audience. She is just getting started at contributing to open source projects and is already addicted. Please send help (don't actually send help)."
    synopsis: "Programming is an adventure, often more harrowing than it has to be. If you're more used to higher-level languages like Ruby or JavaScript, learning a lower-level language like Rust can feel like an impossible journey that leaves you wishing for a well-written and heavily illustrated field guide. Good news! I have already gone down this road and am now prepared to share my adventure with you. Luckily, I was able to capture much of the flora and fauna of Rustlandia with my primitive pictorial devices (paper and pen)."

    bio: "Master of Smile Generation. Ambassador of Company Culture. Tech Entreprenur. Speaker/Educator. One-time Professional Actor @osfashland. Husband. Chief Zealous Officer @CodingZeal"
    synopsis: "It’s never easy to have a tough conversations, and they never go away. Therefore, I see a better way to live with them, and I want everyone to hear it: empower yourself to understand why we do what we do so you can effect change. Understanding creates empathy. Empathy reduces (not eliminates) conflict. This talk is a practical course on the triad of human psychology: language, physiology and focus. I’ll walk through simple strategies that lower stress, create empathy and manage emotions."

    bio: "Brooks Swinnerton is a Brooklyn based Platform Engineer at GitHub where he works on their REST API, webhooks and GraphQL API."
    synopsis: "GraphQL is an exciting new query language that's transforming the way we think about APIs. Used in production by Facebook, GitHub, and Shopify, it challenges RESTful API design by empowering consumers to query for exactly the information they need. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the query language, how GitHub uses it internally with Ruby and Rails, and the lessons they learned launching their GraphQL API externally.</p>"

    synopsis: "Ruby is often praised for being a happy language. For highly motivated developers, a large part of happiness is tied to being productive. How can we extend the productivity gains we experience from writing Ruby to an entire engineering organization? At Strava we are experimenting with a framework we call Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE). DPE applies the principles of Site Reliability Engineering, developed by Google, to improving productivity through automation for both individual engineers and engineering organizations. This talk is a detailed view of the DPE framework and our experience with it so far."

    talk: "Scars: On handling adversity"
    bio: "Notably, I emcee'd the end-of-year talent show at Jackson Middle School in Houston, TX during my second year of Teach for America. Since then I moved to New York and discovered programming, among other things. I'm now learning how to be a dad to my baby boy, Jasper."
    synopsis: "As much as we'd like our programming careers to be filled with great success, it's more than likely we'll encounter setbacks along the way. We may have to deal with impossible clients or projects, imposter syndrome, confusion, self-doubt, and maybe much worse. Perhaps there's a bright side to failure. Let's take a close look at our scars and examine how they can help make us stronger."

    bio: "Sam Phippen is a swashbuckling hacker, from London UK. He lives in New York City now, working for DigitalOcean. He's a member of the RSpec core team. He's ✨ Your Pal Sam ✨. He's sad that he can't hug every cat."
    synopsis: "Every language has at least one big idea behind it. In Ruby we cherish the powers of abstraction in the language and the conventions of Rails. Experienced Ruby programmers lean on these ideas without a thought. Imagine my surprise when I changed jobs, stopped programming Ruby full time, and those ideas were nowhere around. This talk is the antidote to the 'x language is cool talk'; It's a talk where you'll learn about the ideas behind a couple of current hot languages. You'll learn how new languages change the way you program. We'll find some gaps in Ruby and bring some neat stuff back."

    talk: "Front-End Sadness to Happiness: The React on Rails Story"
    bio: "Aloha! Inspired by the Ruby on Rails Community, Justin began blogging on http://www.railsonmaui.com. A burning desire to bring happiness to Rails front-end development led to the open source project React on Rails. Besides open source, he’s the founder and CEO of http://www.shakacode.com and https://www.friendsandguests.com. Justin has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and an MBA from UC Berkeley. Free Time: Surfing and other sports in Hawaii!"
    synopsis: "Standard Rails development made me happy like no other programming paradigm in my career. Simple front-end development with standard Rails and a sprinkling of jQuery was 'OK' Then, in 2014, I had to build a front-end that dynamically updated like a desktop app. I knew there had to be something better, and I went down the rabbit hole of integrating React with Rails using Webpack. Come find out how my obsessive pursuit of “developer happiness” for the Rails front-end eventually drove me to start the React on Rails gem, the most popular integration of Rails with React using Webpack"

    talk: "How to load 1m lines of Ruby in 5s"
    bio: Andrew Metcalf is an engineer at Stripe, where he works on making large Ruby codebases fast, safe, and predictable to work with.
    synopsis: "Applications written in Ruby, Python and several other popular dynamic languages become very slow to boot as they grow to millions of lines of code. Waiting to reload code in development becomes a major frustration and drain on productivity. This talk will discuss how we reduced the time to boot a service at Stripe from 35s to 5s by statically analyzing dependencies in our codebase to drive an autoloader."

Rebecca's hobbies include drinking Cherry Coke Zero, cuddling pugs, and wearing all the colors."
    synopsis: "Trust is at the core of whether we are happy at work or not. Trust is at the core of whether we like who we work with. Trust is at the core of whether people perceive us to be good at our jobs. But what is trust? How do you know when it's missing? And how do you fix it when it's gone. Let's discuss the elements of trust and the patterns of behavior the make or break trust"
