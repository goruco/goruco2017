  		We’re rebuilding GORUCO as a polyglot conference that emphasizes and embodies the best of Ruby’s practices, values, and community. This is an opportunity to extend Ruby’s reach, to pull more people into Ruby’s orbit who share our values, and to keep Ruby alive even as its community members use a much broader set of tools and languages.
